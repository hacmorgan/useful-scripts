* Things that cannot be scripted
- It is usually necessary to modify /etc/systemd/logind.conf in order to control how the system reacts to the power button or lid being closed *this is currently handled in the install script*

- The colour of the zsh autosuggestions can be changed by modifying line 36 of zsh-autosuggestions.zsh. Currently it looks like: typeset -g ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=5'

- For some reason, zsh-autosuggestions has had to be a manual install lately

- To allow forward delete in python with st we must do two things:
  - echo "set enable-keypad on" >> ~/.inputrc
  - put the following lines in zshrc
    function zle-line-init () { echoti smkx }
    function zle-line-finish () { echoti rmkx }
    zle -N zle-line-init
    zle -N zle-line-finish
