Followed the arch install guide

Mostly was good, install vim in the pacstrap step, should've done the same for networkmanager
Also run systemctl enable NetworkManager to make it start at boot

Added exec i3 to ~/.xinitrc
See the arch wiki for starting x at login

Don't forget visudo for editing the sudoers file
